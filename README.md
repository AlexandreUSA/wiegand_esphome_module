# wiegand_esphome_module
custom wiegand component for esphome.

This module allow to connect weigand sensors with esphome.
Its my first module so maybe you find any bad practice in de code.

Copy wiegand_device.h in the root of esphome (bad practice I know that should be treated like a custom component).
Use the .yalm to inspire yours.
